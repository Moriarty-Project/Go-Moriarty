# Go-Sherlock

 an offshoot of how I think the infosec tool Sherlock could be truly used to it's fullest
 
 the overview of this project. Sherlock will have all the actual functions and whatnot to get a users info and history, cli just handles the user interface elements. 
 If this is used in other tools, sherlock would just be imported.
 I will have to come up with a different name than sherlock... at the very least, to have it differentiated from the python application that inspired it...
